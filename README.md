## Boards Evaluated

Boards evaluated are based on:
- ADC AD7771 (Analog Devices)
- ADC ADS131M08 (Texas Instruments)

### Parameters Evaluated

The evaluation covers key parameters:
- **Input Referred Noise (IRN)**
- **Frequency Response**
- **Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)**
- **Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)**
  - Balance test
  - Imbalance test
- **Inputs impedance**

### Experimental Setups for Real-World Evaluation

- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Fist Clenching
- **Electrocardiography (ECG)**: 1 Lead
- **Electrocardiography (ECG)**: 5 Lead
- **Electroencephalography (EEG) and EMG**: Alpha Brain Wave and Eye Blink Detection

## Usage examples
Ensure the board is connected to the same WiFi network as the device running the BrainFlow server.  
**Default port**: `12345`  
The server listens on all interfaces by default.  


### Measure Data Frequency
To measure data frequency (in Hz) of data received from BioListener board:
```shell
python measure_brainflow_data_frequency.py
```

### Plot Data in Real-Time
To plot data in real time, with recording interface available:
```shell
python plot_real_time_with_recording.py
```

### OpenBCI GUI
To bind to OpenBCI GUI, use previous command. The streaming board is created at  
`streaming_board://225.1.1.1:6677`  
_Note_: Customized OpenBCI GUI is required. Future integration with the official GUI is planned.

## Boards evaluation
Evaluation scripts are located in `biolistener_evaluation` directory. They will be combined in Jupiter Notebook in the future.  
**Evaluation Data**: Located in the `data` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Take note! The following Boards evaluation plots, descriptions, data is **Work In Progress** and will be moved in the future to the Jupiter Notebook and described fully. Stay tuned!
